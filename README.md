# Basic-Chatbot
This project is a simple text-based chatbot created using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot recognizes common phrases and responds with predefined answers, simulating a conversational experience. It operates via the command-line and uses NLTK's Chat module for its underlying logic. The chatbot is designed to handle basic greetings, questions, and casual conversations through pattern matching using regular expressions.
To run the chatbot, you need to install Python and the NLTK library. First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the required libraries by running pip install nltk. You may also need to download NLTK data by importing nltk in a Python script and running nltk.download('punkt'). Once everything is set up, you can start the chatbot by running the chatbot.py script and interact with it by typing messages in the console. To end the conversation, simply type 'quit' or 'exit'.
The chatbot responds based on predefined patterns, offering a basic interactive experience. For example, if you greet it with "Hello," it will reply with "Hi! How can I assist you?" The chatbot also handles simple queries like "What is your name?" and even tells jokes upon request. It relies on pattern matching and reflections to make the conversation feel more natural.
In terms of future improvements, the chatbot could be enhanced by integrating more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using libraries like spaCy. This would allow for more complex conversations and better language understanding. Additionally, a graphical user interface could be developed to improve the user experience.
This project serves as a fun way to practice basic Python programming and concepts such as loops, conditionals, and list comprehensions, while exploring the fundamentals of NLP.
